# 2022 Automated API Testing for the Error Mapping Service

This sample of project automates testing for an API that maps error codes across a stack of ~30 microservices. The tests, written in Kotlin with TestNG, verify correct error propagation and handling.

Key Features:
- API Validation: Ensures accurate error mapping across services. 
- TestIT Integration: Allows test execution and creation via keywords, enabling non-technical users to manage tests. 
- Reliable Error Handling: Detects incorrect mappings, missing translations, and unexpected behaviors.
